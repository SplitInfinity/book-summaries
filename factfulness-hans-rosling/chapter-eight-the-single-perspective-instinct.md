# Chapter 8: The Single Perspective Instinct

## Summary
**Factfulness is ... recognizing that a single perspective can limit your imagination**, and remembering that it is better to look at problems from many angles to get a more accurate understanding and find practical solutions. To control the single perspective instinct, **get a toolbox, not a hammer**.

- **Test your ideas**. Don't only collect examples that show how excellent your favourite ideas are. Have people who disagree with you test your ideas and find their weaknesses.
- **Limited expertise**. Don't claim expertise beyond your field: be humble about what you don't know. Be aware too of the limits of the expertise of others.
- **Hammers and nails**. If you are good with a tool, you may want to use it too often. If you have analyzed a problem in depth, you can end up exaggerating the importance of that problem or of your solution. Remember that no one tool is good for everything. If your favourite tool is a hammer, look for colleagues with screwdrivers, wrenches, and tape measures. Be open to ideas from other fields.
- **Numbers, but not *only* numbers**. The world cannot be understood without numbers, and it cannot be understood with numbers alone. Love numbers for what they tell you about real lives.
- **Beware of simple ideas and simple solutions**. History is full of visionaries who used simple utopian visions to justify terrible actions. Welcome complexity. Combine ideas. Compromise. Solve problems on a case-by-case basis.

## Quotes
- Instead, constantly test your favourite ideas for weaknesses. Be humble about the extent of your expertise. Be curious about new information that doesn't fit, and information from other fields. And rather than talking only to people who agree with you, or collecting examples that fit your ideas, see people who contradict you, disagree with you, and put forward different ideas as a great resource for understanding the world. (Page 186)
- Being intelligent -- being good with numbers, or being well educated, or even winning a Nobel Prize -- is not a shortcut to global factual knowledge. Experts are experts only within their field. (Page 188)
- Most countries that make great economic and social progress are not democracies. South Korea moved from Level 1 to Level 3 faster than any country had ever done (without finding oil), all the time as a military dictatorship. Of the ten countries with the fastest economic growth in 2016, nine of them score low on democracy. Anyone who claims that democracy is a necessity for economic growth and health improvements will risk getting contradicted by reality. It's better to argue for democracy as a goal in itself instead of as a superior means to other goals we like. (Page 200)
