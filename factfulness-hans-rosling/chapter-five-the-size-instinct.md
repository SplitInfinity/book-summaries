# Chapter 5: The Size Instinct

## Summary
**Factfulness is ... recognizing when a lonely number seems impressive** (small or large), and remembering that you could get the opposite impression if it were compared with or divided by some other relevant number. To control the size instinct, **get things in proportion**.

- **Compare**. Big numbers always look big. Single numbers on their own are misleading and should make you suspicious. Always look for comparisons. Ideally, divide by something.
- **80/20**. Have you been given a long list? Look for the few largest items and deal with those first. They are quite likely more important than all the others put together.
- **Divide**. Amounts and rates can tell very different stories. Rates are more meaningful, especially when comparing between different-sized groups. In particular, look for rates per person when comparing between countries or regions.


## Quotes
- In terms of economic muscles, "we" are becoming the 20 percent, not the 80 percent. But many of "us" can't fit these numbers into our nostalgic minds. Not only do we misjudge how big our war monuments should be in Vietnam, we also misjudge our importance in the future global marketplace. Many of us forget to behave properly with those who will control the future trade deals. (Page 137)
- "It was you, the richest nations, that put us all in this delicate situation. You have been burning increasing amounts of coal and oil for more than a century. You and only you pushed us to the brink of climate change." Then he suddenly changed posture, put his palms together in an Indian greeting, bowed, and almost whispered in a very kind voice, "But we forgive you, because you did not know what you were doing. We should never blame someone retrospectively for harm they were unaware of." (Page 140)
