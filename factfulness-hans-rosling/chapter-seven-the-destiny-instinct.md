# Chapter 7: The Destiny Instinct

## Summary
**Factfulness is ... recognizing that many things (including people, countries, religions, and cultures) appear to be constant just because the change is happening slowly**, and remembering that even small, slow changes gradually add up to big changes. To control the destiny instinct, **remember slow change is still change**.

- **Keep track of gradual improvements**. A small change every year can translate to a huge change over decades.
- **Update your knowledge**. Some knowledge goes out of date quickly. Technology, countries, societies, cultures, and religions are constantly changing.
- **Talk to Grandpa**. If you want to be reminded of how values have changed, think about your grandparents' values and how they differ from yours.
- **Collect examples of cultural change**. Challenge the idea that today's culture must also have been yesterday's, and will also be tomorrow's.


## Quotes
- It's relaxing to think that knowledge has no sell-by date: that once you have learned something, it says fresh forever and you never have to learn it again. In the sciences like math and physics, and in the arts, that is often true. In those subjects, what we all learned at school (2 + 2 = 4) is probably still good. But in the social sciences, even the most basic knowledge goes off very quickly. As with milk or vegetables, you have to keep getting it fresh. Because everything changes. (Page 180)
- Some Americans think of Sweden as a socialist country, but values can change. A few decades ago Sweden carried out what might be the most drastic deregulation ever of a public school system and now allows fully commercial schools to compete and make profits (a brave capitalist experiment).
