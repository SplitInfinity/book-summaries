# Chapter 4: The Fear Instinct

## Summary
**Factfulness is ... recognizing when frightening things get our attention**, and remembering that these are not necessarily the most risky. Our natural fears of violence, captivity, and contamination make us systematically overestimate these risks. To control the fear instinct, **calculate the risks**.

- **The scary world: fear vs. reality**. The world seems scarier than it is because what you hear about it has been selected -- by your own attention filter or by the media -- precisely because it is scary.
- **Risk = danger x exposure**. The risk something poses to you depends not on how scared it makes you feel, but on a combination of two things. How dangerous is it? And how much are you exposed to it?
- **Get calm before you carry on**. When you are afraid, you see the world differently. Make as few decisions as possible until the panic has subsided.


## Quotes
- Fears that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today help keep journalists employed. It isn't the journalists fault and we shouldn't expect them to change. It isn't driven by "media logic" among the producers so much as by "attention logic" in the heads of the consumers. (Page 107)
- The big facts and the big picture must wait until the danger is over. But then we must dare to establish a fact-based worldview again. We must cool our brains and compare the numbers to make sure our resources are used effectively to stop future suffering. We can't let fear guide these priorities. Because the risks we fear the most are now often -- thanks to our successful international collaboration -- the risks that actually cause us the least harm. (Page 111)
- The general trend towards less violence is not just one more improvement. It is the most beautiful trend there is. The spread of peace over the last decades has enabled all the other improvements we have seen. We must take care of this fragile gift if we hope to achieve our other noble goals, such as collaboration toward a sustainable future. Without world peace, you can forget about all other global progress. (Page 114)
- The memory of insufficient regulation has created automatic mistrust and fear, which blocks the ability to hear data-driven arguments. (Page 116)
