# Chapter 2: The Negativity Instinct

## Summary
**Factfulness is ... recognizing when we get negative news**, and remembering that information about bad events is much more likely to reach us. When things are getting better we often don't hear about them. This gives us a systematically too-negative impression of the world around us, which is very stressful. To control the negativity instinct, **expect bad news**.

- **Better and bad**. Practice distinguishing between a level (e.g. bad) and a direction of change (e.g. better). Convince yourself that things can be both better and bad.
- **Good news is not news**. Good news is almost never reported. So news is almost always bad. When you see bad news, ask whether equally positive news would have reached you.
- **Gradual improvement is not news**. When a trend is gradually improving, with periodic dips, you are more likely to notice the dips than the overall improvement.
- **More news does not equal more suffering**. More bad news is sometimes due to better surveillance of suffering, not a worsening world.
- **Beware of rosy pasts**. People often glorify their early experiences, and nations often glorify their histories.

## Quotes
- People often call me an optimist, because I show them the enormous progress they didn't know about. That makes me angry. I'm not an optimist. That makes me sound naive. I'm a very serious "possibilist". That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that further progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful. (Page 69)
