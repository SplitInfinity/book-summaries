# Chapter 1: The Gap Instinct

## Summary
**Factfulness is ... recognizing when a story talks about a gap**, and remembering that this paints a picture of two separate groups, with a gap in between. The reality is often not polarized at all. Usually the majority is right there in the middle, where the gap is supposed to be. To control the gap instinct, **look for the majority**.

- **Beware of comparisons of averages**. If you could check the spreads you would probably find they overlap. There is probably no gap at all. For example, the average score among men on the math portion of the SAT is 30 points higher the average score among women, but for the majority of women, there exists a man who has the same math score. Similarly, the United States has a higher average income than Mexico, but there is substantial overlap between the distributions of income in the two countries.

- **Beware of comparisons of extremes**. In all groups, of countries or people, there are some at the top and some at the bottom. The difference is sometimes extremely unfair. But even the majority is usually somewhere in between, right where the gap is supposed to be. For example, presented alone, the statement that the richest 10% in Brazil earn 41% of the total income in the country sounds disturbing (and this feeling is bolstered by the media). However, the richest 10% in Brazil earned 50% of the total income in the country in 1989 and this figure has been decreasing ever since.

- **The view from up here**. Remember, looking down from above distorts the view. Everything else looks equally short, but it's not. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 1, 2, and 3 can look equally poor. However, for people who live on Levels 1, 2, and 3, the distinctions between these levels are staggering. They are well aware how much of a difference an additional few dollars per day, a stove, or a car can make in the life of someone on Levels 1, 2, and 3.

## Quotes
- I think this is because human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking, a basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize. Good versus bad. Heroes versus villians. My country versus the rest. Dividing the world into two distinct sides is simple and intuitive, and also dramatic because it implies conflict, and we do it without thinking, all the time. (Page 38)
- Journalists know this. They set up their narratives as conflicts between two opposing people, views, or groups. They prefer stories of extreme poverty and billionaires to stories about the vast majority of people slowly dragging themselves toward better lives. Journalists are storytellers. (Page 38)
- Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. (Page 44)
